As the project lead for 'Encryption and Decryption between Users in Morse Code,' I was responsible for designing
and overseeing the development of a secure communication system that leverages Morse code and optical transmission.
The primary objective was to enable users to exchange encrypted messages using Morse code, transmitted via an LED and
received through a light-dependent resistor (LDR), ensuring both security and reliability.
BSNL industrial visit for Telecommunications
During the BSNL industrial visit, I witnessed the practical implementation of the latest technologies and network infrastructure
used in the telecom industry. I got a chance to learn about various BSNL products and services, gain insights into their day to￾day operations and obtain hands-on learning experience
